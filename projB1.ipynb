    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data,\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models, and\n",
    "- Validate the performance of your model and minimize overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, Feature Engineering, and Logistic Regression. In the second part of this project (to be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset – the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails and wanted to give a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are made aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel uncomfortable with this topic, **please contact your TA, the instructors, or reach out via the [extenuating circumstances form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffIhNMwsxP9Pd5l_9dzx_V4VffsNIOOjOexLT9VgUtmzw4AA/viewform).**"

The dataset is from [SpamAssassin](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/). It consists of email messages and their labels (0 for ham, 1 for spam). Your labeled training dataset contains 8,348 labeled examples, and the unlabeled test set contains 1,000 unlabeled examples.\n",

    "1. `subject`: The subject of the email.\n",
    "1. `email`: The text of the email.\n",
    "1. `spam`: 1 if the email is spam, 0 if the email is ham (not spam).\n",

Recall that to train a logistic regression model, we need a numeric feature matrix $\\mathbb{X}$ and a vector of corresponding binary labels $Y$. Unfortunately, our data are text, not numbers. To address this, we can create numeric features derived from the email text and use those features for logistic regression.\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a function `words_in_texts` that takes in a list of interesting words (`words`) and a `Series` of emails (`texts`). Our goal is to check if each word in `words` is contained in the emails in `texts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `words_in_texts` function should output a **2-dimensional `NumPy` array** that contains one row for each email in `texts` and one column for each word in `words`. If the $j$-th word in `words` is present at least once in the $i$-th email in `texts`, the output array should have a value of 1 at the position $(i, j)$. Otherwise, if the $j$-th word is not present in the $i$-th email, the value at $(i, j)$ should be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project B2, we will be applying `words_in_texts` to some large datasets, so implementing some form of vectorization (for example, using `NumPy` arrays, `Series.str` functions, etc.) is highly recommended. **You are allowed to use a single list comprehension or for loop**, but you should look into how you could combine that with the vectorized functions discussed above. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> words_in_texts(['hello', 'bye', 'world'], \n",
    "                   pd.Series(['hello', 'hello worldhello']))\n",

    "array([[1, 0, 0],\n",
    "       [1, 0, 1]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we **do not** calculate the *number of occurrences* of each word; only if the word is present at least once. Take a moment to work through the example on your own if need be - understanding what the function does is a critical first step in implementing it.\n",
    "\n",

First, we are evaluating the accuracy of the model on the training set, which may provide a misleading accuracy measure. Accuracy on the training set doesn't always translate to accuracy in the real world (on the test set). In future parts of this analysis, we will make use of the data we held out for model validation and comparison.\n",

    "- **False negative (FN)**: A spam email gets mislabeled as ham and ends up in the inbox.\n",

    "To be clear, we label spam emails as 1 and ham emails as 0. These definitions depend both on the true labels and the predicted labels.
